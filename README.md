# cosmic-ray-detector

This is my very simplistic attempt at building a cosmic ray detector, with javascript.

Cosmic rays can cause bits to flip in software, and this detector is built on that principle.

I know it is *very* unlikely to detect a cosmic ray, but please try it out and tell me how it goes.

Personally, I think "Cosmic Ray" would be a great name for a super hero, or super villain.

Also "Cosmic Ray and the Bit-Flippers" would be a great name for a psychedelic surf guitar garage trance nu wave metal shoegaze big band.
